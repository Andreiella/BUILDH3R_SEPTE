**Usecase: Supply chain management**
Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKM) ensure that every step in the supply chain is cryptographically validated, preventing fraud while protecting proprietary details. Its interoperability allows for seamless cross-chain communication among various parties. It helps meet regulatory compliance by allowing auditors to verify compliance without accessing confidential data, thus improving efficiency and trust across supply chains. ZKM can improve supply chain management by providing privacy, transparency, and data integrity.
